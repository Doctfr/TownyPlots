TownyPlots
==========

Adds new plot Types to towny.
TownyPlots will allow town mayors to set advanced plot types like mines, stocks etc. 
These buildings / factories will fill chests inside of them, speed depending on their level. You can level them up by adding specific blocks or extending them in another way, dependent on the building. 
See the Wiki (https://github.com/Pommesritter/TownyPlots/wiki) or config files for more information.

Consider to take a look at https://github.com/herbertsfundgrube/GSplugin , my other Project. Sadly, the Strings are all in german and must be translated ( lang file )
